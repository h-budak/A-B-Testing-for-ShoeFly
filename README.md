In this project I used pandas to take a deeper look at some A/B Testing data. I used aggregates such as count and the formatting?? function pivot to shape the data in several useful ways until I was able to come to a conclusion about which Ad was more performant. Formatting and reformatting tables is a great way to explore data, come to conclusions and present data that informs decisions.
